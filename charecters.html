          Lorelai Gilmore
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-text">
          Lorelai Gilmore, played by Lauren Graham, is the only daughter of
          Richard and Emily Gilmore. She is the mother of Lorelai "Rory" Lee
          Gilmore . She became pregnant at the age of 16 but refused to marry
          Christopher, Rory’s father, because she felt that a marriage at such a
          young age would not work out. Instead, she ran away to the town of
          Stars Hollow, which is half an hour away from Hartford.

        <h2>
          Rory Gilmore
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-text">
          Lorelai “Rory” Gilmore, played by Alexis Bledel, is the only child of
          Lorelai Gilmore and Christopher Hayden, born on October 8, 1984, at
          4:03 a.m. It is evident in the show that Rory and Lorelai share a
          special bond, and maybe even considered best friends. Rory shares her
          mother's taste in junk food, coffee, movies, music, and much more.
          They both exhibit a talent for witty, fast-paced, pop-culture-laden
          dialogue. Rory spent her childhood in the Independence Inn in Stars
          Hollow where her mother originally worked as a maid. Lorelai was later
          able to buy a house in town when Rory was 11, and they remain there
          throughout the end of the show. The series pilot indicates that Rory
          harbors a long-held dream to study at Harvard University, and it is,
          for this reason, she transfers from Stars Hollow public high school to
          the prestigious Chilton Academy.

        <h2>
          Sookie St. James
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-text">
          Sookie St. James, played by Melissa McCarthy, is the loving best
          friend of Lorelai Gilmore. While being a bit on the klutzy side,
          Sookie maintains her position as the executive chef at the
          Independence Inn and later, the co-owner and head chef at the
          Dragonfly Inn. Throughout the series, Sookie is Lorelai's business
          partner and cheerleader. Sookie shares a somewhat antagonistic
          relationship with Michel, the hotel's front desk clerk. She is also
          the one person who consistently champions Lorelai and Luke's romantic
          relationship, even long before the two were actually involved.

          as Mr. Kim, is never seen on camera, nor are his whereabouts ever
          mentioned; but Lane refers to her father in season 1, episode 1, and
          to her "parents" on many other occasions, and specifically refers to
          "my mother and father" in season 2.
