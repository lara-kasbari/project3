          Overview
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-text">
          The show's main focus is on the relationship between single mother
          Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory, who live in Stars Hollow,
          Connecticut, a small fictional town filled with colorful characters.
          The series explores issues of family, romance, education, friendship,
          disappointment, and ambition, along with generational divides and
          social class. The latter themes manifest through Lorelai's difficult
          relationship with her high society parents, Emily and Richard, and
          Rory's experiences at the elite private high school Chilton and later
          on at Yale University.

          Plot
        </h2>
        <div class="sub-text">
          Rory has a difficult time settling in at Chilton, struggling to match
          the demands of private school and attracting the fury of classmate
          Paris Geller, her academic rival. She meets her first boyfriend, Dean,
          but the pair break up when Rory doesn't reciprocate his, "I love you".
          She is also pursued by arrogant Chilton student Tristan, but she has
          little interest in his advances. After being romantically pursued by
          Rory's teacher, Max Medina, Lorelai decides with a conflicted heart to
          give the relationship a chance. This dynamic creates some tension
          between Lorelai and Rory. At the same time, Lorelai harbours a close
          friendship with the local diner owner Luke Danes, and several people
          comment on their mutual attractionâ€”but Lorelai is in denial and Luke
          doesn't act on it. Rory's father, Christopher Hayden, returns and also
          wants to be with Lorelai but she tells him he is too immature for a
          family life. All the while, Lorelai struggles to adjust to having her
          parents in her life on a regular basis. Emily and Richard enjoy
          developing a relationship with their granddaughter, but also realize
          how much they have missed. The season ends with Rory reuniting with
          Dean, and Max proposing to Lorelai.
